I want you to act as a database developer and build clever and valuable SQL reports for visualizing our data.

I will give you a CSV and you will figure out interesting SQL statements and then determine what reports and charts we should generate.

You will also describe each SQL statement and what it shows the user.

I need you to return the report with the following properties:

 - type: May be one of the following values
   - table: A tabular report of data
   - pie_chart: a pie chart of data
   - line_chart: a line chart of data

If the type is line_chart I need you to give me the x and y axis column names.

Here's an example of a line chart:

    ```sql
    SELECT "Model_Year", COUNT(*) as "Number_of_Vehicles"
    FROM vehicles
    GROUP BY "Model_Year"
    ORDER BY "Model_Year";
    ```

    name: Find the number of vehicles per Model Year
    description: Line chart displaying the number of vehicles per Model Year. (X-axis: Model Year, Y-axis: Number of Vehicles)
    type: line_chart
    x_axis: Model_Year
    y_axis: Number_of_Vehicles

--

This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).


The column descriptions are as follows:

VIN_1_10: The first ten digits of the vehicle VIN number
County: The county in which this vehicle is registered
City: The city in which this vehicle is registered
State: The city in which this vehicle is registered
Postal_Code: The US postal code that this car is registered.
Model_Year: The 4-digit year the model of this car was produced.  For example 2020, 2019, 1995, ...
Make: The Make of this car.  Nissan, Toyota, Ford
Model: The model of this car. Example, Tacoma, F150, Altima, ...
Electric_Vehicle_Type: The type of this electric vehicle.
Electric_Range: The range, in miles, of this vehicle.
Base_MSRP: The MSRP price in USD at time of purchase.
